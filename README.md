# -BayeLCA-with-prredict-function-
This is a part of my thesis work under professor Jason Wyse ,https://www.scss.tcd.ie/Jason.Wyse/  .
‘BayesLCA’ package originally written by prof. Arthur white (https://www.scss.tcd.ie/Arthur.White/) is available in R to perform latent class analysis. As my dissertation work ,I have built predict function based on Bayesian Statistics for the package. 
So, my version of this package with predict function is stored here.
